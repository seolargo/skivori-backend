The outcome of your Monte Carlo simulation provides insights into the performance of the slot machine game. Here's a breakdown of the results and what they imply:

1. Total Trials: 100,000
The simulation ran 100,000 independent trials, each starting with a specific balance (e.g., 20 coins) and simulating spins until either the balance was exhausted or the maximum number of spins was reached.
2. Average Reward per Spin: 1.61 coins
Interpretation:
On average, the player receives 1.61 coins per spin in rewards.
Since the cost of a spin is 1 coin, this indicates a positive return for the player overall.
Casino Implication:
This slot machine might not be profitable for the casino unless other factors (like player behavior or house edge) come into play.
3. Average Spins per Trial: 47.35 spins
Interpretation:
On average, each trial lasts 47.35 spins before the player either runs out of balance or stops.
Player Implication:
Players can expect relatively long play sessions, which can be engaging and entertaining.
4. Bankruptcy Rate: 15.41%
Interpretation:
Only 15.41% of players exhaust their starting balance (e.g., 20 coins) during a trial.
The majority (84.59%) manage to maintain or increase their balance by the end of the trial.
Player Experience:
A low bankruptcy rate is favorable for player satisfaction, as it means most players donâ€™t lose all their coins quickly.
5. Reward Distribution
This shows the frequency of each reward occurring across all spins.
Reward	Occurrences	Percentage of Total Spins
3 coins	592,185	~59.22%
5 coins	128,793	~12.88%
10 coins	111,222	~11.12%
15 coins	18,550	~1.86%
20 coins	36,705	~3.67%
40 coins	64,854	~6.49%
50 coins	9,235	~0.92%
Key Observations
Small Rewards Dominate:

The majority of spins (over 59%) yield the smallest reward of 3 coins.
Rewards like 5, 10, and 40 coins are less frequent but contribute to the overall positive return.
Rare Big Wins:

The highest reward (50 coins) occurs in less than 1% of spins.
These rare big wins help create excitement and keep players engaged.
Reward Variety:

The presence of multiple reward tiers (e.g., 5, 10, 40, 50 coins) ensures variability, making the game more dynamic and unpredictable.
Overall Implications
Player Perspective:

Players are likely to enjoy this game because of:
A high average reward per spin.
A low bankruptcy rate.
A good balance between frequent small wins and rare big wins.
Casino Perspective:

The slot machine might not be highly profitable for the casino unless the reward system or spin costs are adjusted.
Casinos typically design games with an average reward per spin below 1 coin to maintain profitability.
What Can Be Adjusted?
Increase Spin Cost:

Raising the cost of a spin to 2 coins would likely reduce the average reward per spin and improve profitability for the casino.
Adjust Reel Probabilities:

Reducing the frequency of symbols like "cherry" or "apple" can make high-value rewards less common.
Lower Reward Amounts:

Reducing the reward values for combinations can improve profitability while keeping the player experience engaging.
